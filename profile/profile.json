Wrote a bash script to collect each terminal's usage data in intervals using the Linux shell and crontab. Developed script to automate connecting to PostGreSQL database and inserting data. Also developed script for the automation of starting/stopping the PostGreSQL docker. The scripts were built and tested through a Rocky Linux 9 VM provisioned through the Google Cloud Platform.",

App was implemented using the core Java util as well as Java nio library and Java Stream api. The app was developed, built, compiled, and packaged using Maven and a Docker image was built and distributed on Docker hub. Testing with JUnit occurred when implementing a method for matching regex expressions to strings.",

The app was built with Core Java 11 and Maven was used to manage dependencies. Notable libraries used: OkHttpClient for sending HTTP requests, Jackson Core library for parsing JSON data to Quote and Position objects. For testing, we used JUNIT5 to write testing methods and Mockito to mock objects during unit testing. The application was dockerized for ease of deployment and the user interface currently sits on the command-line interface.",
