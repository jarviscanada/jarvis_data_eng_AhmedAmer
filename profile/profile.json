      "description": "Designed and implemented a series of bash scripts that would monitor the usage data of a network of Linux machines and store that data within a relational database (PostgreSQL). Wrote a bash script to collect each terminal's usage data in intervals using the Linux shell and crontab. Developed a script to automate connecting to the database and inserting data. Also developed a script for the automation of starting/stopping the PostgreSQL docker container. The scripts were built and tested using a Rocky Linux 9 VM provisioned through the Google Cloud Platform.",

The app was implemented using the core Java Util as well as Java NIO library and Java Stream API. The app was developed, built, compiled, and packaged using Maven and a Docker image was built and distributed on Dockerhub. Testing with JUnit occurred when implementing a method for matching regex expressions to strings.",

Notable libraries used: OkHttpClient for sending HTTP requests, Jackson Core library for parsing JSON data to Quote and Position objects. For testing, we used JUNIT5 to write testing methods and Mockito to mock objects during unit testing. The application was dockerized for ease of deployment and the user interface currently sits on the command-line interface.",

Performed ETL process on publicly available WDI data by leveraging cluster jobs using HiveQL. Analysed the benefits/tradeoffs of storage formats such as columnar vs textfile format, external vs HDFS tables, as well as various optimisation strategies such as partitioned tables. Monitored the progress of jobs, the status of resources and any error logs using YARN and Tez web interfaces. Reported on findings of differences in performance and optimal setups for big data processing with Hadoop clusters.",
