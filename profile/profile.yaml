# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am a self-taught programmer with over 40 certificates in Web Development, Object-oriented Programming, Data Science, and Algorithms. After graduating from one of the most challenging programs at the University of Toronto, I decided to switch careers and pursue my true passion; coding. Throughout my learning journey, I realised the world of coding did not just challenge the growth of my technical skills, it also empowered the manifestation of my creative visions. The result was numerous solo projects and my involvement in building a novel finance-based mobile web app; my first experience as a developer within a team. The combination of my formal education and my single-handed pursuit of programming has helped me develop an ability to think both creatively and critically. Through my achievements thus far, I have also showcased a talent for absorbing complex knowledge in a short amount of time. I feel confident and excited knowing what lies ahead for me within the realms of software development.

    description: Designed and implemented a series of bash scripts that would monitor the usage data of a network of Linux machines and store that data within a relational database (PostGreSQL). Wrote a bash script to collect each terminal's usage data in intervals using the Linux shell and crontab. Developed script to automate connecting to PostGreSQL database and inserting data. Also developed script for the automation of starting/stopping the PostGreSQL docker. The scripts were built and tested through a Rocky Linux 9 VM provisioned through the Google Cloud Platform.
