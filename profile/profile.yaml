# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: Self-taught programmer with a degree in Neuroscience and an incredible passion for programming full-stack applications. After a well-thought-out decision to shift my career focus to software development, I accumulated 1+ years working within professional teams that employed agile software development principles in the development lifecycles of the product. Experience working with React and Tailwind CSS to build frontend, Java to build backend, and SQL to leverage PostgreSQL databases. Interested in a full-stack role under the mentorship of a team lead conducive to my passion for learning and growing both my technical and soft skills.

    description: Designed and implemented a series of bash scripts that would monitor the usage data of a network of Linux machines and store that data within a relational database (PostgreSQL). Wrote a bash script to collect each terminal's usage data in intervals using the Linux shell and crontab. Developed a script to automate connecting to the database and inserting data. Also developed a script for the automation of starting/stopping the PostgreSQL docker container. The scripts were built and tested using a Rocky Linux 9 VM provisioned through the Google Cloud Platform.
  - name: "Core Java Apps - Grep App"
    git_url: "/core_java/grep"
    description: "Designed and implemented a Java application that mimics the Linux CLI grep command - effectively searches for string matches in a file directory and returns the lines associated with the pattern. The app was implemented using the core Java Util as well as Java NIO library and Java Stream API. The app was developed, built, compiled, and packaged using Maven and a Docker image was built and distributed on Dockerhub. Testing with JUnit occurred when implementing a method for matching regex expressions to strings."
  - name: "Core Java Apps - Stock Quote App"
    git_url: "/core_java/jdbc"
    description: "Developed an app with which users can fetch quotes from the Stock Market and purchase/sell shares. The app was built with Core Java 11 and Maven was used to manage dependencies. Notable libraries used: OkHttpClient for sending HTTP requests, Jackson Core library for parsing JSON data to Quote and Position objects. For testing, we used JUNIT5 to write testing methods and Mockito to mock objects during unit testing. The application was dockerized for ease of deployment and the user interface currently sits on the command-line interface."

    description: "Provisioned and configured a Hadoop cluster through Google Cloud Platformâ€™s Dataproc service. Performed ETL process on publicly available WDI data by leveraging cluster jobs using HiveQL. Analysed the benefits/tradeoffs of storage formats such as columnar vs textfile format, external vs HDFS tables, as well as various optimisation strategies such as partitioned tables. Monitored the progress of jobs, the status of resources and any error logs using YARN and Tez web interfaces. Reported on findings of differences in performance and optimal setups for big data processing with Hadoop clusters."
