# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: Self-taught programmer with a degree in Neuroscience and an incredible passion for programming full-stack applications. After a well-thought-out decision to shift my career focus to software development, I accumulated 1+ years working within professional teams that employed agile software development principles in the development lifecycles of the product. Experience working with React and Tailwind CSS to build frontend, Java to build backend, and SQL to leverage PostgreSQL databases. Interested in a full-stack role under the mentorship of a team lead conducive to my passion for learning and growing both my technical and soft skills.

    description: Designed and implemented a series of bash scripts that would monitor the usage data of a network of Linux machines and store that data within a relational database (PostGreSQL). Wrote a bash script to collect each terminal's usage data in intervals using the Linux shell and crontab. Developed script to automate connecting to PostGreSQL database and inserting data. Also developed script for the automation of starting/stopping the PostGreSQL docker. The scripts were built and tested through a Rocky Linux 9 VM provisioned through the Google Cloud Platform.
  - name: "Core Java Apps - Grep App"
    git_url: "/core_java"
    description: "Designed and implemented a Java application that mimics the Linux CLI grep command - effectively searches for string matches in a file directory and returns the lines associated with the pattern. App was implemented using the core Java util as well as Java nio library and Java Stream api. The app was developed, built, compiled, and packaged using Maven and a Docker image was built and distributed on Docker hub. Testing with JUnit occurred when implementing a method for matching regex expressions to strings."
