# Ahmed Amer . Jarvis Consulting

Self-taught programmer with a degree in Neuroscience and an incredible passion for programming full-stack applications. After a well-thought-out decision to shift my career focus to software development, I accumulated 1+ years working within professional teams that employed agile software development principles in the development lifecycles of the product. Experience working with React and Tailwind CSS to build frontend, Java to build backend, and SQL to leverage PostgreSQL databases. Interested in a full-stack role under the mentorship of a team lead conducive to my passion for learning and growing both my technical and soft skills.

## Jarvis Projects

**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AhmedAmer/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Designed and implemented a series of bash scripts that would monitor the usage data of a network of Linux machines and store that data within a relational database (PostgreSQL). Wrote a bash script to collect each terminal's usage data in intervals using the Linux shell and crontab. Developed a script to automate connecting to the database and inserting data. Also developed a script for the automation of starting/stopping the PostgreSQL docker container. The scripts were built and tested using a Rocky Linux 9 VM provisioned through the Google Cloud Platform.

**Core Java Apps - Grep App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AhmedAmer/tree/master/core_java/grep)]: Designed and implemented a Java application that mimics the Linux CLI grep command - effectively searches for string matches in a file directory and returns the lines associated with the pattern. The app was implemented using the core Java Util as well as Java NIO library and Java Stream API. The app was developed, built, compiled, and packaged using Maven and a Docker image was built and distributed on Dockerhub. Testing with JUnit occurred when implementing a method for matching regex expressions to strings.

**Core Java Apps - Stock Quote App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AhmedAmer/tree/master/core_java/jdbc)]: This project designed and implemented an app with which users can fetch quotes from the Stock Market and purchase/sell shares. The app was built with Core Java 11 and Maven was used to manage dependencies. Notable libraries used: OkHttpClient for sending HTTP requests, Jackson Core library for parsing JSON data to Quote and Position objects. For testing, we used JUNIT5 to write testing methods and Mockito to mock objects during unit testing. The application was dockerized for ease of deployment and the user interface currently sits on the command-line interface.


## Highlighted Projects
**React Website**: Developed a web app with React. Styled the webpages responsively, and built styles with the use of custom CSS classes/root variables. Created custom React components such as an animated background hero, navbar, cards, and footer in a unique design for the web app.

**React Daily Tasks App**: Developed a simple, functional React web app for listing daily tasks and checking them off when they are completed. Wrote logic code in TypeScript for functions that implemented the CRUD operations of the app.


## Professional Experiences

**Software Developer, Jarvis (Sep 2024-present)**: Attended agile scrum meetings daily. Worked as part of a team of developers to write Linux bash scripts that monitored memory usage within a network of Linux machines. Wrote scripts that stored that data in a PostgreSQL database in intervals of one minute.

**Software Developer, Kambira (Dec 2023-May 2024)**: Worked hand-in-hand with the founding developers of the company to propel their vision forward as a member of a team. Built the front-end portion of the React.js web app using Tailwind/TypeScript according to designs conceptualized beforehand on Figma. Adjusted and added to designs for pages using Figma. Contributed to both logic and styling code, including buttons, alert messages, user information, and dropdown menus.

**Application Editor, Top Offer (Nov 2020-Apr 2021)**: Edited the spelling, grammar, and contents of over 300 professional letters, emails, and applications to graduate programs across the country for international students. Communicated with cross-functional teams in order to ensure client needs were met on a timely basis. Met extreme deadlines in cases where last-minute edits were requested.
